        <section><p>My name is Dmytro Chebotarov, and I have about a year of experience working in IT industry. 
            I have worked for 3 months in a private enterprise of my friend's father, together with before mentioned friend, managing the 
            database online shop database, working on website to improove it both structuraly and visually and also I've worked
            on scripts and needed programs.
            <br><br>
            My second place of work was OneReach.ai, where I got the position of flow builder after bootcamp. At OneReach I've built and fixed
            numerous flows, I've also worked on a bot that manages interviews, and had highly improoved it and adapted for newer and better tech.
            <br><br>
            I've graduated as bachelor and currently continue studying for a master's degree at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. 
            During studying I have acquired knowlege and experience with multitude of programming languages and principles, such as C, C++, C#, JavaScript, python and Assembler.
            However, I've been using mostly python, JS and C++ since then. Also, I've been studying Java and started a project using Java, but it is still in development.
            <br><br>
            So far i don't have any big projects, at least not finished ones, besides my diploma work. But I do have some finished smaller projects,
            such as discord bot, telegram bot and a desktop app that lets quickly set shutdown time. Also, using navigation on top of this page you can
            access different utilities, such as currency exchanger.
            <br><br>
            I try to learn as quickly and efficiently as possible when i have responsibilities, I adapt quickly to new enviroments and deal with
            high-stress situations pretty good.
            <br><br>
            I'm open to full-time job with an 8-hour work day, fair payment and fair amount of vacation days.
